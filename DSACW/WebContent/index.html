	<p>Welcome to the Secret Share System. This system is designed to upload and download your chosen files
	securely, using cloud vendors. This is the main page, which allows you to change your details, choose a file to upload or download, add a storage account,
	and lastly log out. 

	Thank you for choosing this to securely transfer your files. Before you upload a file, please make sure that you have added enough storage accounts. There must be enough accounts so that no more shares than the threshold should be stored within one account.
